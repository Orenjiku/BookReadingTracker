Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. \n\nBut in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern. \n\nOn a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid — a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. \n\nBut when a neighboring mission goes dark, it''s up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.'

Find the spacecraft Venetia''s Sword and steal it back from Arum Gilger, ex-nobleman turned power-hungry trade boss. He''ll slip in, decode the ship''s compromised AI security, and get out of town, Sword in hand. \n\nFergus locates both Gilger and the ship in the farthest corner of human-inhabited space, a gas-giant-harvesting colony called Cernee. But Fergus'' arrival at the colony is anything but simple. A cable car explosion launches Cernee into civil war, and Fergus must ally with Gilger''s enemies to navigate a field of space mines and a small army of hostile mercenaries. What was supposed to be a routine job evolves into negotiating a power struggle between factions. Even worse, Fergus has become increasingly--and inconveniently--invested in the lives of the locals. \n\nIt doesn''t help that a dangerous alien species thought mythical prove unsettlingly real, and their ominous triangle ships keep following Fergus around. \n\nFoolhardy. Eccentric. Reckless. Whatever he''s called, Fergus will need all the help he can get to take back the Sword and maybe save Cernee from destruction in the process.'

He''s been recovering from that experience in the company of friends, the Shipmakers of Pluto, experts at crafting top-of-the-line AI spaceships. \n\nThe Shipmakers have convinced Fergus to finally deal with unfinished business he''s been avoiding for half his life: Earth. Fergus hasn''t been back to his homeworld since he was fifteen, when he stole his cousin''s motorcycle and ran away. It was his first theft, and nothing he''s stolen since has been anywhere near so easy, or weighed so heavily on his conscience. Many years and many jobs later, Fergus reluctantly agrees that now is the time to return the motorcycle and face his family. \n\nUnfortunately, someone has gotten to the motorcycle before him. And before he can figure out where it went and why the storage unit that held it is now filled with priceless, stolen art, the Shipyard is attacked. His friends are missing, presumably kidnapped. \n\nAccompanied by an untrustworthy detective who suspects Fergus is the art thief and the sole friend who escaped the attack, Fergus must follow the tenuous clues to locate and save his friends. The trail leads them to Enceladus, where Fergus plans to go undercover to the research stations that lie beneath the moon''s thick ice sheet deep in a dark, oppressive ocean. \n\nBut all movement and personnel are watched, and the limited ways through the thick ice of the moon''s surface are dangerous and highly monitored. Even if Fergus can manage to find proof that his friends are there and alive, getting out again is going to be a lot more complicated than he bargained for.'
